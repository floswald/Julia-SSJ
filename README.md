# Julia-SSJ
Training material to help solve Heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) models in Julia using the Sequence Space Jacobian method (Auclert et. al., 2021).

Solve a Krussell-Smith model by calling the `mainKS()` function in `KrussellSmith.jl`. 
All parameters are defined within that function, so feel free to play around with different parameterizations.

More detailed training material coming soon.
